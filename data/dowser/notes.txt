the number of atoms in residues types dowser
can use is too low, therefore

at the begining of dowser/CODE/reformatPDB.c

replace
#define MAXTYPES 500
#define MAXMERGE 100

with
#define MAXTYPES 5000
#define MAXMERGE 1000

recompile
./dowser/Install

To use Dowser++
Install Dowser++ from: http://dowserplusplus.ucdavis.edu/
Add to the folder the file callDowser++.sh which can be found in the basekit
CHANGE the PATH of DOWSERPLUS2_CMD to the folder where Dowser++ is installed + callDowser++.sh
In callDowser++.sh should the line: fname=$(python /home/student/Documents/basekit/basekit/parameterizationDowserPlus2.py $fname $2) changed in a way that the PATH is going to basekit.
Dowser++ should now be working when the command line argument -d++ is added with mppd.py
